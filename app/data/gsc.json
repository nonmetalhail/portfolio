      "p":"The editor is currently bare-bones, but will continue to evolve as I tinker with it in my spare time and add more contries/states. The hardest part was creating the former East Germany boarder. I could not find any decent standalone file for the boarder, so I had to create it by drawing only the boader between specific German states."
