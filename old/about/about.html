                Hi, I&rsquo;m Elliot! I&rsquo;m an architect turned building scientist turned information 
                scientist. I guess that makes me part designer, part scientist, and part engineer.
            </p>    
            <p>
                A California native, I studied architecture in college. After college, I worked 
                as an architect, and later a construction cost estimator.  While I worked in the 
                building industry, I developed a strong desire to make the built environment a 
                more <a href = "http://www.xkcd.com/1007/" target = "_blank">sustainable</a> place. In pursuit of 
                this goal, I began a MS program in Building Science believing that research and 
                knowledge is key in implementing change. 
            </p>    
            <p>                
                While in grad school, I became interested in building energy dashboards and how 
                information, when presented thoughtfully, can influence people&rsquo;s behavior and act 
                to conserve resources. This interest served me later as I applied my broad set of 
                skills working at a non-profit, the Institute for the Sustainable Performance of 
                Buildings (Superb). At Superb, I aided in the development of educational software 
                intended to teach building professionals the basics of high performance buildings.
            </p>    
            <p>
                My interest in information visualization and experience developing educational 
                software then led me to the <a href = "http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/" target = "_blank">I School</a> 
                where I have found my calling in User Experience design.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The process of UX design resonates with me. In architectural design, the emphasis is 
                more often than not about space and voids, guided by the architect&rsquo;s own hubris, 
                rather than a clear focus on the user&rsquo;s needs. As someone who wanted to design 
                things for people, the architect&rsquo;s focus was counter-intuitive. I&rsquo;m glad to 
                finally be in a place where others share similar perspectives on design.
            </p>    
            <p>
                When not harping on architects, I enjoy the hiking-<a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/7175744@N02/" 
                target = "_blank">photography</a> nexus, cooking 
                delicious meals, baking bread and fancy cakes, nerding out over TED talks, and playing 
                my guitar or listening to music (from bluegrass to the symphony).
