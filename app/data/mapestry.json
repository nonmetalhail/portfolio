      "p":"We started with an idea: maps and visual media can be a medium to evoke rich oral histories in the ones you love. With this thesis, we set about building a suite of tools to collect, organize, and share these stories."
    },
    {
      "p":"Following a human centered design process, we did a deep dive into the world of oral histories, investigating the tools and methods currently available, and discovering the needs of both amateur and professional users. In the end, we settled on building a platform for an average amateur enthusiast."
    },
    {
      "p":"The mobile and tablet apps integrate maps and other visual assets to go beyond a standard recording app with features to inspire detailed conversations. Bookmarking, topic lists, media, and maps are all available to seed discussions with features allowing either the interviewer or the interviewee to drive the conversation."
    },
    {
      "p":"The web app is where narratives are shaped. Recordings are synced automatically with the mobile and tablet apps. Stories are refined through a lightweight audio editor. Locations, images, video, and text content can be added throughout the narrative."
    },
    {
      "p":"When stories are ready to share, projects can be easily published for family membersâ€”or for the world. As the story plays, the audio narrative is synced with map locations and other media, creating a richer experience than audio alone."
    },
    {
      "p":"This project won the prestigious James R. Chen Award in Enhancing Information Systems in 2013."
