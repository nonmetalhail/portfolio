                	<p>
                    	My primary project with the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) was designing and building a kiosk system to administer thermal comfort surveys 
                        to transient occupants (people who occupy a space for a short period of time, say under 30 min). Typically, surveying this type of building occupant 
                        is difficult, requiring a lot of time and money spent in data collection. The purpose of building the kiosk is that it would allow for self-administered 
                        surveys and drastically reduce the cost of gathering data.The caveat is that the survey had to be short and intuitive enough for any passerby to be able 
                        to take it without assistance. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						The survey kiosk is a computer with a touch screen interface and running a survey I developed in Flash (come on, give me a break! It was a couple years ago before Flash fell from 
                        grace). The Flash front-end communicated with a PHP back-end to record the survey results. Attached to the computer is a temperature & humidity sensor 
                        to record the ambient conditions inside the building. The PHP script also queried the data from this sensor and stamped all responses with the environmental 
                        conditions.
                    </p>
					<p>
						The survey questions and various iterations of the design can be seen in the photos. Design style and color schemes varied as the project 
                        moved forwards. User testing was performed on later iterations to ensure clarity of the survey questions and ease of interaction. Effects from these testings can particularly be 
                        seen in the readdition of the temperature scale bars from the first mockup to the final design, and in the changes from the functional mockup of Survey Page 2 to the final design. 
                    </p>
					<p>
                    	Also shown are images of the posters created to brand and advertise the kiosk in the building and one graph of some data gathered by the kiosk. 
                        Finally, the predecessor of the kiosk is depicted, which shows a push-button box capable of asking only one question and thereby yielding very ambiguous data....
                    </p>
					<p>
						Special thanks should go to Katie Ackerly for her assistance in designing the posters.

                        <a href = "http://crossfit.com/" target = "_blank"> CrossFit</a> is a fitness routine which combines multiple other fitness styles. 
                        Some key aspects of CrossFit is that the workout routines change daily and there is a focus on tracking individual 
                        progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this project is to extend the CrossFit community such that coaches and members can have a better platform
                        for interaction. In particular, we will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a tool for coaches to program workouts</li>
                        <li>Providing a simple way for members to record their performance</li>
                        <li>Displaying performance data in a clear and relevant way</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We began by performing contextual inquires of CrossFit coaches and members. 
                        This was followed by distilling their needs, developing work flow models, and developing user personas, finding 5 
                        main groups of users--coaches, competitive members, regular gym members, beginners, and independent CrossFiters. 
                        We have decided to focus on the needs of the coach's (as their buy-in will help produce a critical mass needed for 
                        other user groups to join) and the needs of regular gym members (some of whose needs generally overlap with other 
                        gym goers or can be modified later). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we had chosen these user groups, we have moved onto developing some rapid prototypes of three main features: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A web app to programming workouts for the coaches (which I have focused on)</li>
                        <li>A web app to view gym and user stats (for coaches and gym members)</li>
                        <li>A mobile app to log member's workout performance. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                        We iterated through many designs moving from paper prototypes, balsamiq mock-ups, and finally, a fully functional html site. After each iteration, we conducte formative and heuristic evaluations on these prototypes with designers and with CrossFit coaches.

                    	In this class project for Info Vis, I created a viewer to analyze results from energy simulations I have been 
                    	running as part of my Building Science Masters thesis. It uses the <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/" target="_blank">d3.js</a> 
                    	javascript library to compare two simulations and generates a series of small multiples bar charts.

                    <p>
                        The data shows EUI (energy by square-foot) data, broken down by end use and separated by representative cities. 
                        The cities themselves are arranged in a matrix on the page based on climate zone and climate type (see ASHRAE map). 
                        Blanks exist because there are no such climate zone-type combinations in the US.

                <div class = "port_data_right">
                	<p>
                    	In this project, I created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometrics" target="_blank">psychrometric chart </a> in Excel. When studying the built environment, 
                    	it is often useful to graph environmental data on one of these charts and contrast it to HVAC setpoints 
                        and industry defined thermal comfort zones. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						In my former lab, Center for the Built Environment (CBE), researchers would often plot data on 
                        psychrometric charts manually by drawing points with tools such as Adobe Illustrator or MS Powerpoint. 
                        Although software tools with psychrometric chart graphing capabilities do exist, they are tailored towards 
                        mechanical engineers and packaged with many expensive and overly complicated add-ons. What my lab needed was 
                        a cheap, straightforward, and easy to use option. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						In response to this need for an intuitive and automatic psychrometric graphing tool, I decided to build 
                        one. Originally, I was going to use it as an opportunity to further my Processing skills. However, as I 
                        began to consider the problem in more depth, I realized Processing was a silly choice. In the end, I would 
                        end up with a pretty, but harder to use product&#x2014;one that interrupted the researchers' work flow. 
                    </p>
					<p>
                    	The researchers at CBE are all well versed in Excel and use it for most of their data analysis and graphing. 
                        Rather than making the researchers export their data from Excel and into my Processing program, it made much 
                        more sense just to build a tool in Excel using VBA. This would allow for a more seamless flow from the 
                        researchers' data analysis, to visualizing their data. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						The psychrometric chart allows the researcher to specify the chart ranges and increments for Temperature on 
                        the <em>x</em>-axis and Humidity Ratio on the <em>y</em>-axis. Researchers can also specify what increment they want for the 
                        Wet Bulb lines and the Relative Humidity curves. I also included a converter, which can take Relative Humidity 
                        data (which is what is usually collected) and convert it to Humidity Ratio data (which is the <em>y</em>-axis). Finally, 
                        I wrote a method to allow researchers to specify a shaded zone; in this way, researchers can easily specify 
                        important regions of the chart such as the thermal comfort zones. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						Since this chart uses VBA to create the graph and axillary axes, researchers can easily graph their data 
                        using the native Excel functions they are accustomed to.

                	<p>
                    	While teaching building science basics to undergraduate students, we introduced them to basic 
                    	simulation software. One such program is a design tool created in Excel called Shade. Shade takes 
                    	basic inputs about a building and outputs suggested percent shading requirements for different times 
                    	of the year. However, the old version of Shade did not accomplish many of the goals it set out to accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, Shade is intended as a design tool; all design is an iterative process but Shade did not easily 
                        support iteration and the ability to contrast two designs. Second, Shade required annual setup by the 
                        instructors. Each year, the final project guidelines would change and instructors had to manually input weather 
                        data for the chosen climates&#x2014;a very tedious process. Third, Shade failed as an education tool in that it 
                        provided suggestions for when to optimally shade windows, but it did not concisely demonstrate how input effects 
                        the overall performance of the building. Similarly, inputs were grouped haphazardly rather than in a logical, 
                        consistent manor which would aid student's understanding of the underlying theories. Finally, the algorithms 
                        which Shade ran were obfuscated by use of linked tables making it difficult for advanced students who wanted to 
                        understand the process of running these simulations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After teaching Arch 140 and being frustrated by these limitations, I decided to take it upon myself to redesign 
                        and recode Shade. I decided to leave it in Excel and use VBA as it was easily accessible to students and there 
                        would be no compatibility issues (Save for the lack of VBA support for Office 2008 for Mac of which I was unaware). 
                        Since I would not be around to constantly fix any issues that might arise with changing operating systems and 
                        versions, it seemed that Excel would be safe. Also, since the VBA code would be viewable by anyone running the 
                        program, it would support the ability for advanced students to learn the process running in the back-end. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve it's flexibility as a design tool, I added space for two design iterations and the ability to compare 
                        the two designs. Users can also copy values from one design to another, allowing students to perform a design 
                        iteration, analyze, and immediate run another comparison to a new design. Inputs were groups by category to both 
                        make entry easier, and to reinforce the underlying concepts presented in the course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make it easier on instructors and avoid tedious data entry every year, I added a "Load Weather File" button 
                        which automatically loads the necessary data from a specified file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I included graphs that visualized the the loads on the building as a result of the student's design 
                        choices. This allows students to assess the trade-offs and true impacts of their design on end energy use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, a shoutout goes to Katie Ackerly for assisting with the graphic design choices and aiding in developing the work models</p>
